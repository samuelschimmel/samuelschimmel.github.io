# Hydration and sleep

I try to drink at least 2 gallons of water per day. I try to drink 1 gallon within the first 2 hours of waking up when I'm most dehydrated from sleeping.

Get a BPA-free water bottle. Wash it every day or every other day. Have a few so you can rotate between them while the other is in the dishwasher.

# Sun Protection

## The Importance of Sun Protection

The sun emits 2 kinds of radiation: UVA and UVB.
UVB causes sunburn. UVA causes premature skin aging (more in next bullet point). Both UVA and UVB can cause skin cancer.
Sun exposure is responsible for 80-90% of premature visible aging - you can look literally decades younger than your actual age if you wear sunscreen and use other forms of sun protection every day over the course of your life.
American sunscreens typically only block UVB. European, Japanese, and South Korean sunscreens block both UVA and UVB.
The PA rating system (PA+ to PA++++) is used in Japan and is like the SPF rating system but for UVA rather than UVB. SPF only covers UVB. If you get a Japanese sunscreen be sure it's PA++++. If you get a European sunscreen be sure it has the UVA seal (https://imgur.com/LSoWfbU).
Windows and clouds block UVB, but not UVA, which is why it's still necessary to wear sunscreen indoors (unless you have all your windows covered with UPF blackout curtains and have no CFL bulbs like we do), in the car, on cloudy days, and during the winter.
Don't rely on just one form of sun protection. The more you can combine the better. For example, use sunscreen, wear sun hats/sunglasses/UPF clothes, and take Heliocare. Additional forms of sun protection is never redundant or overkill.
Contrary to popular belief, sun exposure is not at all necessary for vitamin D. You can just take vitamin D supplements. You can get them at Costco (https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-extra-strength-d3-50-mcg.%2c-600-softgels.product.11467951.html) and they are very cheap. I take 3/day. The sun is actually a very inadequate source of vitamin D, so if you live in the northern hemisphere and are relying on sun exposure for vitamin D, you are probably vitamin D deficient and need to take supplements anyway. You can ask your primary care doctor to test your levels. Even if you're not deficient you may want to take vitamin D supplements, as the optimal range for vitamin D levels is much higher than the "sufficient" range.

## Sunscreen

Daily sunscreen: https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Super-Moisturizing-Essence-version/dp/B0BSFK47H3/
I strongly recommend putting this on your face and neck (and scalp for Dad) every morning. Even if you're going to be inside all day, even if it's cloudy, even if it's winter, etc.
Outdoor sunscreen: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YGVSGMW
This is more heavy duty, I would use this if you're going to be out in the sun for any significant amount of time (and reapply after every 2 hours of sun exposure).
Japanese sunscreen recommendation site if you want to do more research: https://www.ratzillacosme.com/

## Other sun protection stuff I recommend (the more you do, the better)

Sun hat: https://www.amazon.com/Hat-UPF-Protection-Waterproof-Fishing-Breathable/dp/B07DB2XYZ2/
I would strongly recommend wearing one of these every time you go outside when the sun is up. They provide tons of protection and there's literally no reason not to wear one.
SPF lip balm: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09GQY5SNF/
Apply this every time you apply sunscreen, lips are super vulnerable to skin cancer.
Consider getting dedicated prescription sunglasses in addition to your transition lenses glasses. You can ask your optician but I suspect dedicated sunglasses provide greater sun protection. Additionally, the sunglasses we have have much bigger lenses, which means they protect not only our eyes but the skin around our eyes which is extremely delicate and difficult to apply sunscreen to without getting it in your eyes.
UPF face covering: https://www.amazon.com/Coolibar-Mens-Womens-Vermilion-Layered/dp/B07Z8DCPP4/
Other UPF clothes
UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) is like SPF but for clothes. You can (and should) get UPF shirts, hoodies, shorts, pants, etc.
T-shirt: https://www.amazon.com/Carhartt-T-shirt-Relaxed-Midweight-X-Large/dp/B096VSK7D5/
Long-sleeve polyester shirt (I wear these under my t-shirts): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078B5GY3N/
Darker clothes are more UV resistant than lighter clothes, but a high UPF rating is most important
Cover your windows with at least 1 layer of UPF blackout curtains
Heliocare: https://www.amazon.com/Heliocare-Advanced-Nicotinamide-Supplement-Niacinamide/dp/B07MH34HP4/
Supplement that provides sun protection, highly recommend
Replace any CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs you have with LED bulbs as CFLs emit UV radiation

Get car windows tinted (doctors note in WA for windshield, still may not be strictly legal)

# Skincare

- Don't use shampoos, face washes, or body washes with SLS and other sulfates (most producsts at the store have these)
- Rosacea

# Oral Care

Nimbus toothbrushes (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LB7C4U/) which our dentist recommended and are very soft and gentle. According to him, electric toothbrushes can be bad if you have gum recession
Sensodyne Pronamel (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0762LYFKP/) or Sensodyne Fresh Mint (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H88H4Q0/) for toothpaste. These are some of the few widely available toothpastes without sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which is used in lots of personal care products and is SUPER harmful. At one point last year we accidentally started using a toothpaste with SLS in it and our gums literally started sloughing, which went away after we switched back. There are other variants of Sensodyne that do have SLS so watch out (that's what we accidentally got, also we found out the hard way SLS isn't always on the label). But Pronamel and Fresh Mint are SLS-free. We also switched to face washes, body washes, and shampoos are that are SLS-free since SLS is also bad for skin
PreviDent 5000, a prescription high fluoride toothpaste that I brush with at night after brushing with Sensodyne
PerioSciences AO ProVantage dental gel (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077H52NGB/) which our dentist gave me for a soft tissue injury once, it helped a lot with healing so I started using it twice a day after brushing
 
SuperTeeth dental probiotics, we both take one in the morning and one at night after brushing (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CNFTFPLJ/)
We recently started using a WaterPik Ion water flosser, it's definitely not a substitute for flossing but a good supplemental thing to do after flossing (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08V1LS3FZ/)
Same for Soft-Picks, not a substitute for flossing but a good supplement to it (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GHFTKT4/)
Also recently started using gum stimulators which my dentist recommends (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C86CGH5P/)
Xylitol is known to be great for oral health, I chew xylitol gum after every meal (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015NFYIY/)
Specifically for dry mouth I use these products:
Biotène mouthwash (most mouthwashes like Crest contain tons of gum-irritating ingredients): https://www.amazon.com/biotène-Mouthwash-Breath-Freshener-Treatment/dp/B002KAOAZ4/
Biotène lozenges: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RG6TPL2/
Biotène gel: https://www.amazon.com/OralBalance-Moisturizing-Flavor-Free-Alcohol-Free-Packaging/dp/B0064QVBFC/
XyliMelts which you can stick to your gums overnight: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09219ZXRG/
Another thing that can be helpful is taping your mouth shut at night using tape made for skin (https://www.amazon.com/Nexcare-Strong-Pain-Free-Removal-hospital/dp/B00KOC7FFM/) to avoid breathing through your mouth at night which is very bad for oral health (our sleep doctor actually recommended this)
