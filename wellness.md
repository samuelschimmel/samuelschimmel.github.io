# Preamble

I find myself frequently dispensing health advice to friends and family members. In particular I give a lot of advice about sun protection, because it is alarmingly overlooked in our deranged sun-worshipping post-WWII American culture. I also compiled a list of less obvious oral care tips that I have sent to several folks. So I decided to combine these into a single document and add some other healthy lifestyle practices I recommend. This guide is not intended to be a comprehensive wellness guide, but rather a compilation of less obvious or intuitive information that I have discovered over the years through research, and I generally avoid belaboring common sense advice. Very little in this guide requires seeing a doctor or getting a prescription, it's mostly all OTC products and daily habits that anyone can implement.

# Foundations

I don't have a ton to say about these topics, but I start with them because they are some of the most important foundations of a healthy lifestyle.

## Hydration

I try to drink at least 2 gallons of water per day. In particular I try to drink 1.5 gallon within the first 2 hours of waking up when I'm most dehydrated from sleeping.

Get a BPA-free water bottle. Wash it every day or every other day. Have a few so you have spares and can rotate between them while the others are in the dishwasher.

## Sleep

Insufficient sleep causes irreparable brain damage. Always get at least 8 hours of sleep per night.

## Hypertension

Many adults have hypertension (elevated blood pressure). Get a home blood pressure monitor, learn how to interpret the numbers, and check your blood pressure. Have your feet flat on the floor and put the cuff directly on your arm with no fabric in between. Checking your blood pressure at home may give you more accurate results that in a doctor's office, as many people are anxious when they go to the doctor. If your blood pressure is elevated, see a primary care doctor and get a blood pressure medication prescription. For some reason when I found out I have hypertension I was scared of blood pressure medication side effects and wasted a lot of time trying to lower my blood pressure by changing my diet. In retrospect, this was extremely stupid and I really regret it. I now take 50 mg losartan potassium every day and have experienced zero side effects. Untreated hypertension causes permanent organ damage over time. There's no reason to delay starting a blood pressure medication if you have hypertension.

# Sun Protection

## tl;dr

Regardless of season or weather conditions, using UVA sunscreen everyday, and wearing a sun hat and sunglassses when you're outside and the sun is up, are the absolute most important things you can do to limit premature aging and look young in middle age and beyond. There are many things you can do to reduce UV exposure, which I detail in this section, but as with most things in life, you can get 80% of the benefits with 20% of the efforts. **In this case that means applying sunscreen with UVA protection to your face and neck every morning (don't forget SPF lip balm), and wearing sunglasss and a wide-brimmed UPF sun hat whenever you're outside and the sun is up.**

## The Importance of Sun Protection

Post WWII there has been a ton of misinformation about the sun in the US. The sun is not your friend, it is a giant ball of carcinogenic radiation. Most people know about the risks of sun burn and skin cancer, but not photoaging. Sun exposure is responsible for 80-90% of premature visible aging. UV damage (including through clouds and windows) is permanent and cumulative over the course of your lifetime. I know the sun feels great but it is unbelievably damaging to your skin without sunscreen - even in small doses (it all adds up over your lifetime), even if you’re not burning, even through windows, even in the winter, even if it’s cloudy. You can look literally decades younger than your actual age if you wear sunscreen and use other forms of sun protection every day over the course of your life. Part of the confusion is that photo aging doesn't show when you're young - sun damage from your early years can take years or even decades to show up.

The sun emits 2 kinds of radiation: UVA and UVB.

UVB causes sunburn. UVA causes premature skin aging (more in next bullet point). Both UVA and UVB can cause skin cancer.

Sun exposure is responsible for 80-90% of premature visible aging - you can look literally decades younger than your actual age if you wear sunscreen and use other forms of sun protection every day over the course of your life.

Most people greatly underestimate the very permanent dangers of getting sunburned. Every sunburn you get over the course of your life permanently doubles your chances of getting skin cancer.

Do not try to tan. A tan is your body's response to sun damage and if you are tanning it means you're not using enough sun protection.

American sunscreens typically only block UVB. European, Japanese, and South Korean sunscreens block both UVA and UVB.
The PA rating system (PA+ to PA++++) is used in Japan and is like the SPF rating system but for UVA rather than UVB. SPF only covers UVB. If you get a Japanese sunscreen be sure it's PA++++. If you get a European sunscreen be sure it has the UVA seal (https://imgur.com/LSoWfbU).

Windows and clouds block UVB, but not UVA, which is why it's still necessary to wear sunscreen indoors (unless you have all your windows covered with UPF blackout curtains and have no CFL bulbs like we do), in the car, on cloudy days, and during the winter.

Don't rely on just one form of sun protection. The more you can combine the better. For example, use sunscreen, wear sun hats/sunglasses/UPF clothes, and take Heliocare. Additional forms of sun protection is never redundant or overkill.

Apply snscreen 30 minutes before going outside. Reapply for every 80-120 minutes of sun exposure.

Contrary to popular belief, sun exposure is not at all necessary for vitamin D. You can just take vitamin D supplements. You can get them at Costco (https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-extra-strength-d3-50-mcg.%2c-600-softgels.product.11467951.html) and they are very cheap. I take 3/day. The sun is actually a very inadequate source of vitamin D, so if you live in the northern hemisphere and are relying on sun exposure for vitamin D, you are probably vitamin D deficient and need to take supplements anyway. Trying to get your vitamin D from sun exposure is like trying to get your calories from rectal feeding - you can technically do it, but that doesn’t mean you should. You can ask your primary care doctor to test your levels. Even if you're not deficient you may want to take vitamin D supplements, as the optimal range for vitamin D levels is much higher than the "sufficient" range.

Certain medications increase sun sensitivity (NSAIDs do, ibuprofen doesn’t, source)

## EPA tips

Regardless of the UV Index, the following sun safety measures are always encouraged:

- Do Not Burn.
- Avoid Sun Tanning and Tanning Beds.
- Generously Apply Sunscreen to all exposed skin using a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of at least 15 that provides broad-spectrum protection from both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. Re-apply every two hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating.
- Wear Protective Clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses, where possible.
- Seek Shade when appropriate, remembering that the sun's UV rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
- Use Extra Caution Near Water, Snow and Sand as they reflect the damaging rays of the sun which can increase your chance of sunburn.
- Watch for the UV Index.
- Get Vitamin D Safely through a diet that includes vitamin supplements. Don't seek the sun.

I would change "at least 15 SPF" to "at least 30 SPF." Personally I never use anything less than 60 SPF. Also be sure to use a European, Japanese, or Korean sunscreen with UVA protection, as most American sunscreens lack do not provide adequate UVA protection.

## Sunscreen

Daily sunscreen: https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Super-Moisturizing-Essence-version/dp/B0BSFK47H3/
I strongly recommend putting this on your face and neck (and scalp for Dad) every morning. Even if you're going to be inside all day, even if it's cloudy, even if it's winter, etc.

Outdoor sunscreen: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YGVSGMW
This is more heavy duty, I would use this if you're going to be out in the sun for any significant amount of time (and reapply after every 2 hours of sun exposure).

Japanese sunscreen recommendation site if you want to do more research: https://www.ratzillacosme.com/

## Other sun protection stuff I recommend (the more you do, the better)

Stay hydrated: in addition to being great for all of your other organs, being very hydrated is amazing for your skin, gives it greater resistance to sun damage, and helps it heal better from sun burn.

Sun hat: https://www.amazon.com/Hat-UPF-Protection-Waterproof-Fishing-Breathable/dp/B07DB2XYZ2/
I would strongly recommend wearing one of these every time you go outside when the sun is up. They provide tons of protection and there's literally no reason not to wear one.

SPF lip balm: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09GQY5SNF/
Apply this every time you apply sunscreen, lips are super vulnerable to skin cancer.

Consider getting dedicated prescription sunglasses in addition to your transition lenses glasses. You can ask your optician but I suspect dedicated sunglasses provide greater sun protection. Additionally, the sunglasses we have have much bigger lenses, which means they protect not only our eyes but the skin around our eyes which is extremely delicate and difficult to apply sunscreen to without getting it in your eyes.

UPF face covering: https://www.amazon.com/Coolibar-Mens-Womens-Vermilion-Layered/dp/B07Z8DCPP4/

Other UPF clothes
UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) is like SPF but for clothes. You can (and should) get UPF shirts, hoodies, shorts, pants, etc.
T-shirt: https://www.amazon.com/Carhartt-T-shirt-Relaxed-Midweight-X-Large/dp/B096VSK7D5/
Long-sleeve polyester shirt (I wear these under my t-shirts): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078B5GY3N/
Sun gloves: https://www.sunsibility.co.uk/product-category/sunsibility-collection/sunsibility-sun-protective-accessories/uv-protective-gloves/
Scarf or keffiyeh to protect your neck and shoulders
Darker clothes are more UV resistant than lighter clothes, but a high UPF rating is most important

UPF blackout curtains

Vitamin C serum before sunscreen in the morning provides extra sun protection

Heliocare: https://www.amazon.com/Heliocare-Advanced-Nicotinamide-Supplement-Niacinamide/dp/B07MH34HP4/
Supplement that provides sun protection, highly recommend

CoQ10

Replace any CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs you have with LED bulbs as CFLs emit UV radiation
https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/study-fluorescent-light-bulbs-emit-high-levels-of-uv-radiation/
https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/08/08/158426970/energy-efficient-lightbulbs-have-a-dark-side-when-it-comes-to-health
https://www.livescience.com/25999-cfl-uv-radiation-skin.html

Get car windows tinted (doctors note in WA for windshield, still may not be strictly legal)

## Do I need to wear sunscreen indoors?

Yes, unless: you're going to be at home inside all day, all your windows are covered with at least 1 layer of UPF blackout curtains, and you don't have any CFL light bulbs. If you're going outside at all, even to take your dog out, it's more than worth it to apply sunscreen.

# Skincare

Don't use shampoos, face washes, or body washes with SLS and other sulfates (most producsts at the store have these)

Stay hydrated and avoid alcohol.

In the shower, wash your body first, and wash your head last so your face is wet for as little time as possible (the longer it's wet, the more it dries out).

Pat your skin dry with a soft towel. Do not rub your skin with a towel. If your towels are old, rough, and scratchy, replace them.

CBD lotion from a dispensary. I apply it everywhere below the neck after showering. Provides both moisturization and anti inflammation.

Red light therapy: https://goalstogetglowing.com/2022/11/18/led-mask-omnilux-mens-review/

Never shave facial or body hair with a razor, always use an electric trimmer. Use aftershave lotion afterwards to reduce irritation.

## My Skincare Routine

### AM

### PM

# Oral Care

Nimbus toothbrushes (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LB7C4U/) which our dentist recommended and are very soft and gentle. According to him, electric toothbrushes can be bad if you have gum recession

Sensodyne Pronamel (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0762LYFKP/) or Sensodyne Fresh Mint (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H88H4Q0/) for toothpaste. These are some of the few widely available toothpastes without sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which is used in lots of personal care products and is SUPER harmful. At one point last year we accidentally started using a toothpaste with SLS in it and our gums literally started sloughing, which went away after we switched back. There are other variants of Sensodyne that do have SLS so watch out (that's what we accidentally got, also we found out the hard way SLS isn't always on the label). But Pronamel and Fresh Mint are SLS-free. We also switched to face washes, body washes, and shampoos are that are SLS-free since SLS is also bad for skin
PreviDent 5000, a prescription high fluoride toothpaste that I brush with at night after brushing with Sensodyne

PerioSciences AO ProVantage dental gel (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077H52NGB/) which our dentist gave me for a soft tissue injury once, it helped a lot with healing so I started using it twice a day. I keep it in my mouth for at least 10 minutes (e.g., while I'm in the shower) for maximum absorption.
 
SuperTeeth dental probiotics, we both take one in the morning and one at night after brushing (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CNFTFPLJ/)

We recently started using a WaterPik Ion water flosser, it's definitely not a substitute for flossing but a good supplemental thing to do after flossing (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08V1LS3FZ/)

Same for Soft-Picks, not a substitute for flossing but a good supplement to it (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GHFTKT4/)

Also recently started using gum stimulators which my dentist recommends (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C86CGH5P/)

Xylitol is known to be great for oral health, I chew xylitol gum after every meal (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015NFYIY/)

Specifically for dry mouth I use these products:
Biotène mouthwash (most mouthwashes like Crest contain tons of gum-irritating ingredients): https://www.amazon.com/biotène-Mouthwash-Breath-Freshener-Treatment/dp/B002KAOAZ4/
Biotène lozenges: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RG6TPL2/
Biotène gel: https://www.amazon.com/OralBalance-Moisturizing-Flavor-Free-Alcohol-Free-Packaging/dp/B0064QVBFC/
XyliMelts which you can stick to your gums overnight: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09219ZXRG/

Tongue scraper: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B257614L/

Another thing that can be helpful is taping your mouth shut at night using tape made for skin (https://www.amazon.com/Nexcare-Strong-Pain-Free-Removal-hospital/dp/B00KOC7FFM/) to avoid breathing through your mouth at night which is very bad for oral health (our sleep doctor actually recommended this)

# Nutrition

Meat is horrifyingly unethical and disastrous for the environment. Unfortunately it is also one of the healthiest things you can eat, especially chicken, turkey, steak, fish, and shrimp. Most of my meals are combinations of a meat, vegetables, a high-fiber grain (brown rice) or tortilla, and cheese.

# Fitness

## Flexibility

1. Dynamic stretches
2. Foam roller
3. Yoga
4. Static stretches

## Strength

Most important is form and range of motion. Go as deep as you can with squat, ideally past 90 degrees. Weight less important. Compound lift with minimal weight added or just body weight is much better than a machine exercise that lets you lift more but does all the stabilization for you

Flat lifting shoes (trail runners), lifting belt (only last two sets), knee sleeves (hang up between workouts and wash every few workouts, just for squats and squat accessories)

Pyramid sets

1. Stretch
2. Compound set: push/pull: deadlift (alternate conventional and sumo), box squat (plyometric platform) (as deep as you can go), bench press (alternate bar and db)
3. Accessory set push/pull
4. Core set
5. Stretch

## Cardio

Not an efficient way to lose weight but still very important

# Supplements

Examine, Labdoor

## Capsules

### Supplements

- Anti-inflammation/joint health
  - Triple action joint health
  - Glucoasmine with chondroitin and/or MSM
  - Turmeric/curcumin
- Heliocare: see sun section
- Fish oil: should be refrigerated
- Probiotics
- Maca
- Ashwaganda

### Vitamins

- Vitamin D
- Magnesium glycinate
- Vitamin E
- Zinc/copper 

## Powders

Jars and lids

- Collagen peptides
- Creatine
- Taurine
- Beta-alanine
- Citrulline malate

# Cleaning

- Most cleaning products (including many brands that market themselves as "green") contain ingredients that are carcinogenic and irritating to human tissue. EWG has a guide to cleaners here: https://www.ewg.org/cleaners/
- Vacuuming/dusting (wear KN95)
- Air purifiers. As with most things I would refer to the Consumer Reports guide on air purifiers for choosing a model: https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/air-purifiers/
