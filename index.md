Hello, I am a recent computer science graduate looking for software engineering and gameplay programming opportunities! I graduated magna cum laude from DigiPen Institute of Technology, a game development college in Redmond, WA. I have a background in high performance C++ programming; strong data structures and algorithms fundamentals; familiarity with networking, databases, and backend web development; several semesters of experience as a teaching assistant; and a shipped game on Steam with over 100 reviews, 88% of which are positive.

At DigiPen I was a teaching assistant for several programming classes including Data Structures and Computer Networks I and II. Data Structures is a fourth-semester class and requires students to build a fixed block memory manager in C++. Computer Networks I teaches C socket programming using UDP, TCP/IP, and HTTP. Computer Networks II, an elective, teaches distributed systems, cloud computing, and RESTful APIs using Amazon EC2, Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis. Computer Networks II also teaches real-time state replication. Students modify the client and server for a simple C++ multiplayer game to support "dead reckoning" latency hiding, as well as build a login server that can talk to the game server, and deploy both on EC2. Some of the other electives I took at DigiPen include Calculus III, Advanced Databases, and Artificial Intelligence for Games, in which I implemented a behavior tree, A* pathfinding, terrain analysis, and player modeling.

I have two games in my portfolio, a first-person shooter developed in Unreal Engine 4 using C++, and a stealth game developed in Unity using C#. I was the technical director and lead gameplay programmer on both projects. The FPS, Perdition, was made with seven other students over the course of three semesters. It was demoed at PAX West 2019, and published on Steam, where 88% of its 101 user reviews are positive. Please visit samuelschimmel.com/unreal to view a full playthrough and a behind the scenes look at various gameplay mechanics I implemented!

Prior to studying computer science, I completed a BA in political science and part of a BA in game design, so I have backgrounds in writing, research, systems design, and UI/UX design as well.

I graduated in 2021, and after taking some time off for medical reasons, I am now actively searching for fulltime and contract software engineering and gameplay programming roles! I am based in Redmond, WA and open to remote work anywhere in the US. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
